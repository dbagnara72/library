% Aluminum plate liquid cooled with a size fit for primepack2
% heat exchange made by an aluminum plate with a liquid flow > 28 l/min
% "A" as "ambient" here means water: so HA means delta temperature between water and
% heatsink surface
% moreover the delta temperature between water in and water out is maximum
% 5K assuming a overall power losses of 2kW
